abstract: |
 Population diversity can stabilize ecological dynamics and increase resilience to future environmental change. In exploited systems, however, management goals to preserve diversity may be in tension with harvest objectives. For example, fisheries managers may forgo opportunities to sustainably harvest abundant populations to reduce risks to less productive populations. Increasing the stock selectivity of fisheries is one management lever that may allow for both conservation- and catch-based objectives to be met. We develop a model simulating the dynamics of a Pacific salmon stock aggregate and its fishery to evaluate how changing allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries influences management performance. We focus on relatively generic management strategies that may be implemented in a range of salmon fisheries. Additionally we examine how the relative performance of mixed- and single-stock fisheries change under alternative ecological and management scenarios. We find that increasing single-stock fishery allocations can increase aggregate abundance and the status of stocks relative to conservation benchmarks. However these trade-offs do not occur uniformly across stocks -- relatively abundant, productive populations exhibit no change or even declines in conservation performance as single-stock fishery allocations increase. Furthermore, differences in performance between mixed- and single-stock fisheries are reduced when productivity is uniformly low, mortality during freshwater migrations is high, or when the mixed-stock fishery is managed conservatively. While single-stock fisheries can increase the probability that conservation-based objectives will be met, they are not a panacea and may only be effective when specific conditions are met.
