# INTRODUCTION

Resource management is characterized by trade-offs between conservation- and harvest-based objectives. Fisheries managers, for example, are tasked with ensuring that populations remain sufficiently abundant to minimize extinction risk and sustain intact ecosystems. While conservation objectives are often legally prioritized, managers are simultaneously under pressure to meet harvest objectives related to food security, cultural traditions, or economic development. To reconcile these tensions, fisheries scientists have attempted to design harvest strategies that account for trade-offs between harvest and conservation, while remaining robust to uncertainty [@Punt2016].

Many fisheries are multi-stock, composed of reproductively isolated populations that differ in productivity, capacity, and sustainable exploitation rates [@Ricker1973; @Hilborn1985]. The simplest management approach, and historically the most frequently employed, is to identify target harvest rates based on the dynamics of stock aggregates defined by management boundaries rather than underlying population structure [@Stephenson2002a]. If the dynamics of stocks within the fishery are similar, or exploitation is low, such a strategy may be effective. When these assumptions are not met, however, harvest rates that are sustainable at the aggregate scale may deplete less productive stocks and result in extirpation [@Ricker1973; @Reiss2009]. 

Reductions in stock diversity can negatively impact conservation and harvest objectives by increasing spatial and temporal variability of catches as ecological portfolio effects weaken [@Hilborn2003; @Schindler2010; @Freshwater2019] and reducing long-term resilience to future climate change [@Anderson2015]. Ultimately minimizing harvest of depleted populations in mixed-stock fisheries may be necessary to maintain stock diversity. One strategy is to implement highly precautionary management targets for ecological aggregates that are based on the dynamics of the least productive stock(s). While such actions will reduce the probability of overfishing across all stocks, it is likely to increase tension between conservation and socio-economic objectives as yield is lost from productive populations. In cases where declines in landings have already strained fishing communities, further reductions may receive substantial political opposition.

One method of reconciling conservation and socio-economic objectives is to shift harvest effort towards single-stock fisheries, which allow managers to reduce the risk of overexploitation of less productive stocks while capitalizing on the surplus production of other stocks. Increasing stock selectivity (i.e. the ability to target specific stocks) is particularly relevant to Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) where stocks are highly structured, but most harvest occurs in mixed-stock fisheries [@DFO2017a]. Stocks within salmon management aggregates often vary in status, and in extreme cases aggregates include stocks that sustain large commercial fisheries, as well as stocks of critical conservation concern.  

Extensive efforts have been made to fine-tune commercially important salmon fisheries to maximize their stock selectivity. Variation among stocks in migratory routes or timing are incorporated into run reconstructions, which generate stock-specific harvest rates and, ultimately, time series of stock-specific recruit abundance [@Cunningham2018]. Given sufficient spatial or temporal segregation among stocks, managers can utilize these data to reduce fishing mortality on depleted stocks [@Walters2008; @Cunningham2019]. In other cases, however, the overlap among stocks is too great for closures to be effective. For example within the Fraser River sockeye salmon (*O. nerka*) aggregate, the abundant Chilko and endangered Quesnel stocks co-migrate and are harvested in the same mixed-stock fishery [@COSEWIC2017]. In such instances, stock selectivity could be increased by developing terminal fisheries close to spawning grounds [@Walters2008]. 

As knowledge of population structure improves, it will be possible to more broadly utilize management levers that adjust the proportion of a fishery that is mixed- or single-stock. While the challenges associated with mixed-stock salmon fisheries have been widely documented [@Ricker1973; @Hilborn1985; @Walters2019], the tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic goals associated with single-stock fisheries have not been explicitly quantified. Furthermore, it is unclear how such tradeoffs may be impacted by non-stationary population dynamics and other ecological processes. For example, en route mortality during freshwater migrations can exceed 90% in certain years [@Cooke2004], is likely to occur more frequently with climate change [@Martins2012], and will disprortionately impact the abundance available to terminal fisheries. 

Here we use stochastic closed-loop simulations to evaluate how shifting salmon harvest from mixed- to single-stock fisheries impacts a suite of performance metrics. We first develop abundance-based harvest control rules for mixed- and single-stock fisheries that could be implemented using commonly available data. We then evaluate how changes in allocation affect conservation- and catch-based performance. Finally, we quantify how trade-offs associated with shifting from mixed- to single-stock fisheries may be moderated by population productivity and en route mortality.
