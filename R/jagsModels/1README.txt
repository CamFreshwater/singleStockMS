These files are all Model files for running various Ricker models, referenced in "Functions.R" File

The following files are used in the retrospective analysis as reported in March 2016, and fit
  all CUs simulataneously, even if they are independent

SimpleRicker - Basic Bayesian Ricker model with uniform prior on Smax

SimpleRicker Norm - As above but with lognormal prior on Smax

RecursBayesMS - Recursive Bayes Ricker with uniform prior on Smax

RecursBayesMS - As above with lognormal prior on Smax

MultiStockHier - Hierarchical Bayesial Ricker model with uniform prior on Smax

MultiStockHierNorm - As above with lognormal prior on Smax

The following files are not used in the retrospective analysis as reported in March 2016, but
  might be used in future analysis. They have NOT been updated to fit all CUs (therefore only
  fit one CU at a time).

MultiStockBayes -  Recursive Bayes with mean alpha for each site chosen from global distribution
                    Alpha is time varying with covariation, measured by rho 

RecursBayesMean - Recursive Bayes Ricker where alpha is an AR1 process, with autocorrelation 
                  around some mean value, MuA for each site, only differnt from MultiStockBayes in that
                  MuA for each site is not from global distribution

RecursBayesFixedB -  Recursive Bayes model with beta estimated using basic Ricker model, and all data.  This beta 
                    is then used in recursive Bayes model, held constant over time.
                    

Additional files (added April 15, 2018)

MultiStockHierPSF - Model written by contractor B. Connors to estimate stock-recruit parameters
					for Pacific Salmon Foundation. Compared to estimates generated by C.
					Freshwater for north coast chum to ensure consistency between groups.
