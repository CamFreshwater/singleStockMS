Differences between PSF and DFO hierarchical models:

- Parameters passed externally in DFO, defined in model for PSF
	- Not sure where priors (prmub and prtaub) are defined in PSF
	model, appear to be externally
	- From Corman and English 2013: mean of prior for Smax = avg.
	escapement; unclear how this meshes w/ model code where no
	reference to Smax
- Tau estimated with gamma distribution directly in DFO, indirectly 
from SD (defined by uniform dist) in PSF
- PSF model seems to be based on log normal distributions; as a
result Ricker model is highly simplified and based on ln(recruits)
- DFO prior for capacity is on Smax, while for PSF it is on B directly
	- Prior for Smax has mean = mean escapement and CV of 10 in PSF
- According to documentation, different Ricker structures
	- PSF: R = S * exp(a - bS + err)
	- DFO: R = a * S * exp(-bS + err)
