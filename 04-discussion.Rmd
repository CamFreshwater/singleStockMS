# Discussion

Shifting harvest from mixed- to single-stock fisheries may provide a means of maximizing harvest opportunities on abundant populations while minimizing risks to sympatric stocks of concern. While increasing stock selectivity has intuitive conservation benefits for salmon fisheries [@Walters2008; @Taylor2009], the trade-offs among harvest and conservation objectives of such a transition are rarely quantified. Using a stochastic, closed-loop simulation model, we found that increasing allocations to single-stock fisheries resulted in improved conservation performance, albeit at the cost of reduced catches. However, we also determined that trade-offs between objectives were sensitive to the ecological scale of performance metrics, the structure of each fishery's harvest control rule, and the population dynamics within the stock aggregate.

At the aggregate scale, fully single-stock fisheries maximized return abundance and the proportion of stocks above conservation benchmarks, while fully mixed-stock fisheries resulted in reduced conservation performance, as well as reductions in long-term catches and catch stability due to recruitment overfishing. Intermediate allocations that split total allowable catch between mixed- and single-stock fisheries approximately equally typically maximized catch metrics without substantial declines in conservation performance. These results were driven by multiple factors. First, single-stock fisheries were more conservative than mixed-stock, resulting in a negative relationship between single-stock allocations and total exploitation rate. Second, even though the mixed-stock harvest control rule aimed to maintain aggregate exploitation rates at or below the level associated with maximum sustainable yield, it failed to account for differences among stocks in productivity, which reduce sustainable exploitation rates [@Ricker1973]. Third, the mixed-stock harvest control rule's reference points assumed that aggregate population dynamics were stationary and did not account for recent declines in productivity [@Peterman2012; @Freshwater2018]. Single-stock fisheries were more responsive to annual (generational) changes in stock-specific abundance, such that exploitation declined when spawner abundances dropped below conservation benchmarks.

The impacts of single-stock fisheries were not homogeneous, but varied among populations due to differences in intrinsic productivity and carrying capacity. While the conservation performance of smaller, less productive stocks improved as single-stock allocations increased, more productive or abundant stocks exhibited mixed responses. For example, the Harrison stock's abundance regularly exceeded the conservation benchmark necessary to allow single-stock harvest to occur. Hence realized exploitation rates, as well as catch and conservation performance, were largely independent of fishery allocation. Conversely, the Chilko stock was negatively impacted by increasing single-stock fishery allocations because intermittent closures resulted in years where escapement exceeded capacity, triggering declines in abundance and catch (note that escapements exceeding capacity may provide important ecosystem services not internalized here, e.g. nutrient subsidies to terrestrial systems [@Helfield2001]). Differences in yield among stocks may be driven by variation in productivity and the magnitude of density dependent effects, as in our model, or vulnerability to a mixed-stock fishery [@Walters2008]. Regardless of mechanism, different responses among populations suggest stock-specific trade-offs should be considered when evaluating the benefits of changing allocations.

Various single-stock fishery frameworks could be implemented, including those that supplement catch through additional harvest in terminal areas [@DFO2017a], effectively attempting to fish each stock at close to its maximum sustainable yield. Yet such strategies are relatively "data-hungry", requiring individual stock assessments that are often lacking [@Price2008; @Holt2015], and may only produce marginal gains in long-term yield [@Walters2008]. Instead our goal was to implement a relatively simple and conservative single-stock harvest control rule that could increase the probability of maintaining stock diversity with small additional requirements in management capacity. In this case, the decision to open a particular stock's fishery could be made prior to the start of the fishing season based on recent abundance relative to benchmarks (either derived from stock-recruit parameters or, if those are lacking, average spawner abundance). This strategy attempts to address the primary goal of maintaining stock diversity [@DFO2005], without being overly constrained by data limitations.

Improvements in conservation performance as single-stock allocations increase will be sensitive to the underlying harvest control rules within each fishery. For example, mixed-stock Fraser River sockeye salmon fisheries are currently managed with a total allowable mortality rule - a framework that includes a range of precautionary adjustments, as well as a maximum exploitation rate (60%) that is below estimates of $u_{msy}$ for most stocks [@Pestal2011]. When we simulated an equivalent rule, mixed-stock fisheries had no evidence of recruitment overfishing and moderate declines in conservation performance relative to single-stock fishery management procedures. Thus there may be little benefit to developing single-stock fisheries if mixed-stock fisheries include sufficiently precautionary reference points. Such reference points often depend on relatively precise estimates of stock-recruit parameters and highly collaborative multi-year modeling efforts [@Pestal2011]. When these resources are unavailable, as is common for many stock aggregates, reference points for precautionary harvest control rules could be derived based on indices of abundance relative to historical averages [@Price2008; @Holt2015] or habitat-based estimates of capacity [@Parken2006], but these have not yet been widely applied.

The performance of single-stock fisheries will be sensitive to ecological processes outside of fisheries managers' control. For example, when productivity declines are widespread, abundance-based mixed-stock harvest control rules still result in low exploitation rates and single-stock fisheries provided minimal additional improvements. As a result, a transition to single-stock fisheries is unlikely to counteract declines in salmon abundance driven by widespread, synchronous declines in marine survival [@Peterman2012]. In fact, increasing covariance among stocks may result in modest improvements in the performance of mixed-stock harvest control rules as aggregates increasingly behave like single populations [@Freshwater2019].

Options to increase stock selectivity are limited when a salmon aggregate contains populations that share similar migration phenologies [@Walters2008]. In such a situation developing single-stock fisheries likely requires moving harvest to terminal areas and additional management considerations. First adult fish will recruit into terminal fisheries only after completing their freshwater migrations. En route mortality rates can exceed 90% in certain years [@Cooke2004] and high mortality events are likely to increase due to climate change impacts [@Martins2011]. Thus terminal single-stock fisheries will have access to less harvestable biomass than downstream fisheries, resulting in smaller landings. Furthermore, management uncertainty in terminal fisheries may increase if precise estimates of spawner abundance are not available in-season for all stocks, increasing the consequences of overharvest if stocks are at low abundance due to en route mortality.

The decision to change allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries must ultimately incorporate diverse socio-economic factors. For example, the landed value per weight of terminal catches will be lower than marine caught fish, leading to reduced profits, because salmon expend large portions of their energy reserves while migrating [@Taylor2009]. Perhaps more importantly, increasing single-stock harvest will result in changes in access among user groups. Ideally a full management strategy evaluation could be used to specify conservation and socio-economic objectives of all stakeholders, then quantify trade-offs prior to changes in allocation [@Punt2016]. Nevertheless, these simulations demonstrate that intermediate strategies that incorporate both mixed- and single-stock fisheries may improve conservation performance while minimizing reductions in catch.
