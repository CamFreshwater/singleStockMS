# INTRODUCTION

Resource management is characterized by trade-offs between conservation- and harvest-based objectives. Fisheries managers, for example, are tasked with ensuring that populations remain sufficiently abundant to minimize exitinction risk and sustain intact ecosystems. While conservation objectives are often legally prioritized, managers are simultaneously under pressure to meet harvest objectives related to food security, cultural traditions, or economic development. To reconcile these tensions, fisheries scientists have attempted to design harvest strategies that maximize yield and minimize the risk of overexploitation. For example, management strategy evaluations can be used to develop harvest control rules in a collaborative manner, while accounting for pervasive uncertainty [@Punt2016].

Many fisheries are multi-stock, composed of reproductively isolated populations, which may exhibit differences in productivity, capacity, and sustainable exploitation rates [@Ricker1958; @Hilborn1985]. The simplest management approach, and historically the most frequently employed, is to identify target harvest rates based on the dynamics of stock aggregates defined by management boundaries rather than underlying population structure [@Stephenson2002a]. If the dynamics of stocks within the fishery are relatively similar, or exploitation is sufficiently low, such a strategy may be effective. When these assumptions are not met, however, harvest rates that are sustainable at the aggregate scale may deplete less productive stocks and result in extirpation [@Ricker1958; @Reiss2009]. 

Reductions in stock diversity can negatively impact conservation and harvest objectives by increasing spatial and temporal variability of catches as ecological portfolio effects weaken [@Hilborn2003; @Schindler2010; @Freshwater2019]. Given uncertainty about future environmental conditions, maximizing stock diversity is a critical means of increasing long-term resilience [@Anderson2015; @Link2018]. To that end, minimizing harvest rates of depleted populations in mixed-stock fisheries may be necessary to reduce overexploitation risks. One strategy is to implement highly precautionary management targets for ecological aggregates that are based on the dynamics of the least productive component stock(s). While such a strategy will reduce the probability of overfishing across all stocks, it is likely to increase tension between conservation and socio-economic objectives as yield is lost from more productive stocks. In cases where declines in fleet size or landings have already strained fishing communities, further reductions may receive substantial political opposition.

One method of reconciling conservation and socio-economic objectives is to shift harvest effort towards single-stock fisheries, which allow managers to reduce the risk of overexploitation of less productive stocks while capitalizing on surplus production of productive stocks. Increasing the stock selectivity (i.e. the ability to target some stocks over others) is particularly relevant to Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) where stocks are highly structured, but the majority of harvest currently occurs in mixed-stock marine fisheries. Many salmon management aggregates are composed of both abundant and depleted stocks, and in extreme cases include stocks that sustain large commercial fisheries, as well as stocks of critical conservation concern. For example within the Fraser River sockeye salmon (*O. nerka*) aggregate, the abundant Chilko and endangered Quesnel stocks are harvested in the same mixed-stock fishery [@COSEWIC2017]. 

Extensive efforts have often been made to fine-tune large, commercially important salmon fisheries to maximize their stock selectivity. Variation among stocks in migratory routes or timing are incorporated into run reconstructions, which generate stock-specific harvest rates and, ultimately, time series of spawner and recruit abundance [@Cunningham2018]. Given sufficient spatial or temporal segregation among stocks, managers can utilize these data to reduce fishing mortality on depleted stocks [@Walters2008; @Cunningham2019]. When the overlap among stocks is too great for closures to be effective, stock selectivity may also be increased by moving harvest towards spawning grounds and developing terminal fisheries [@Walters2008]. 

As knowledge of population structure improves, it will be possible to more broadly utilize management levers that adjust the proportion of a fishery that is mixed- or single-stock. While the challenges associated with mixed-stock salmon fisheries have been widely documented [@Ricker1973; @Hilborn1985; @Walters2019], the tradeoffs between conservation and socio-economic goals associated with single-stock fisheries have not been explicitly quantified. Furthermore, it is unclear how such tradeoffs may be impacted by non-stationary population dynamics and other ecological processes. En route mortality, the proportion of adult recruits dying during freshwater migrations, may have particularly severe impacts on the viability of single-stock fisheries. En route mortality rates can exceed 90% in certain years [@Cooke2004], are likely to occur more frequently with climate change [@Martins2012], and will disprortionately impact terminal fisheries. 

Here we use a stochastic closed-loop simulation model to evaluate how shifting Pacific salmon harvest from mixed- to single-stock fisheries impacts a suite of performance metrics. We first develop abundance-based harvest control rules for mixed- and single-stock fisheries that could be implemented using commonly available data. We then evaluate how changes in allocation moderate conservation- and catch-based performance. Finally, we quantify how trade-offs associated with shifting from mixed- to single-stock fisheries may be moderated by population productivity and en route mortality. We note that the impacts of changes in allocation will vary among user groups, dramatically complicating any management process; however it was beyond the scope of the current study to fully account for socio-economic trade-offs related to access.
