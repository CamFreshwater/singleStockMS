# Discussion

Shifting harvest from mixed- to single-stock fisheries may provide a means of maximizing harvest opportunities on abundant populations while minimizing risks on sympatric stocks of concern. While increasing stock selectivity has intuitive conservation benefits for Pacific salmon fisheries [@Walters2008; @Taylor2009], to our knowledge, the trade-offs among harvest and conservation objectives of such a transition has not been previously quantified. Here we used a stochastic, closed-loop simulation model to explore these trade-offs as allocations to single-stock fisheries increase. We focused on generic harvest control rules that could be widely applied to Pacific salmon fisheries. We found that increasing allocations to single-stock fisheries resulted in improved conservation performance, albeit at the cost of reduced catches. We also determined that trade-offs between these objectives are sensitive to the ecological scale of performance metrics, the structure of each fishery's harvest control rule, and the population dynamics within the stock aggregate.

At the aggregate scale, fully single-stock fisheries maximized return abundance and the proportion of stocks above conservation benchmarks. Conversely, shifting harvest allocations entirely to mixed-stock fisheries resulted in reduced conservation performance, as well as reductions in long-term catches and catch stability due to recruitment overfishing. Intermediate allocations, which split total allowable catch between mixed- and single-stock fisheries approximately equally, typically maximized catch metrics without substantial declines in conservation performance. These results were driven by multiple factors. First, single-stock fisheries were more conservative than mixed-stock, resulting in a negative relationship between single-stock allocations and total exploitation rate. Second, even though the mixed-stock harvest control rule aimed to maintain aggregate exploitation rates at or below the level associated with maximum sustainable yield, it failed to account for differences among stocks in productivity, which reduce sustainable exploitation rates [@Ricker1973]. Third, the mixed-stock harvest control rule's reference points assumed that aggregate population dynamics were stationary and did not account for recent widespread declines in sockeye salmon productivity [@Peterman2012; @Freshwater2018]. Single-stock fisheries were responsive to annual (generational) abundances, such that exploitation declined when spanwer abundances dropped below conservation benchmarks, while the mixed-stock fishery did not.

The impacts of single-stock fisheries were not homogeneous within the aggregate, but varied among populations due to differences in intrinsic productivity and carrying capacity. While the conservation performance of smaller, less productive stocks improved as single-stock allocations increased, more productive or abundant stocks exhibited mixed responses. For example, the Harrison stock's spawner abundance regularly exceeded the conservation benchmark necessary to allow single-stock harvest to occur. Hence realized exploitation rates, as well as catch and conservation performance, were largely independent of fishery allocation. Conversely, the Chilko stock was negatively impacted by increasing single-stock fishery allocations because intermittent closures resulted in years when escapement exceeded capacity. Although relatively rare, these events triggered density dependent declines in return abundance and catch. We note that escapements exceeding capacity may provide beneficial ecosystem services (e.g. nutrient subsidies to terrestrial systems [@Helfield2001]), but that these objectives were not explicitly accounted for here. Within our model, differences in yield among stocks are driven by variation in productivity and the magnitude of density dependent effects. In reality, apparent differences in productivity may arise due to variation among stocks in natural mortality rates or in vulnerability to a mixed-stock fishery [@Walters2008]. Regardless of mechanism, different responses among populations suggest both aggregate and stock-specific trade-offs should be considered when evaluating changes in allocation.

Improvements in conservation performance as single-stock allocations increase will be sensitive to the underlying harvest control rules within each fishery. For example, mixed-stock Fraser River sockeye salmon fisheries are currently managed with a total allowable mortality rule - a framework that includes a range of precautionary adjustments, as well as a maximum exploitation rate (60%) that is below estimates of $u_{msy}$ for most stocks [@Pestal2011]. When we simulated an equivalent harvest control rule, mixed-stock fisheries had no evidence of recruitment overfishing and only moderately smaller return abundances than predominantly single-stock fishery management procedures. Thus there may be minimal benefits associated with developing single-stock fisheries if mixed-stock fisheries include sufficiently precautionary reference points. Such reference points, however, depend on relatively precise estimates of stock-recruit parameters and highly collaborative multi-year modeling efforts [@Pestal2011]. When these resources are unavailable, as is common for many stock aggregates, reference points for precautionary harvest control rules could be derived based on indices of abundance relative to historical averages [@Price2008; @Holt2015] or habitat-based estimates of capacity [@Parken2006], but these have not yet been widely applied.

A wide range of single-stock fishery frameworks could be implemented, including those that attempt to maximize aggregate catch through supplemental harvest in terminal areas [@DFO2017a], effectively attempting to fish each stock at close to its maximum sustainable yield. Yet such strategies are relatively "data-hungry", requiring assessments for individual component stocks that are often lacking [@Price2008; @Holt2015], and may only produce marginal gains in long-term yield [@Walters2008]. Instead our goal was to implement a relatively simple and conservative single-stock harvest control rule that could increase the probability of maintaining stock diversity with small additional requirements in management capacity. Under the simulated harvest control rule, the decision to open a particular stock's fishery could be made before the fishing season begins based on recent abundance relative to stock recruit benchmarks (or relative to the time series average if those are lacking). This strategy attempts to address the primary goal of maintaining stock diversity [@DFO2005], without being overly constrained by data limitations.

The performance of single-stock fisheries will be sensitive to ecological processes outside of fisheries managers' control. For example, when productivity declines, even less conservative harvest control rules may result in low exploitation rates as long as they are linked to abundance. In such a scenario single-stock fisheries provided minimal additional improvements in conservation performance because fishing does not occur regardless of how quota is allocated. As a result, a transition to single-stock fisheries is unlikely to counteract declines in salmon abundance driven by widespread, synchronous declines in marine survival [@Peterman2012; @Dorner2017]. In fact, increasing covariance among stocks, as observed in Fraser River sockeye salmon, may result in modest improvements in the performance of mixed-stock harvest control rules as stock aggregates increasingly behave like single populations [@FreshwaterSub].

Options to increase stock selectivity are limited when a salmon aggregate contains large numbers of populations that share similar migration phenologies [@Walters2008]. In such a situation developing single-stock fisheries likely requires moving harvest to terminal areas and several additional management considerations. First adult fish will recruit into the fishery only after completing their freshwater migrations. En route mortality rates can exceed 90% in certain years [@Cooke2004] and high mortality events are likely to increase due to climate change impacts [@Martins2011]. Thus terminal single-stock fisheries will have access to less harvestable biomass than downstream marine fisheries, resulting in reduced catches. Furthermore, management uncertainty in terminal fisheries may increase if precise estimates of spawner abundance are not available in-season for all stocks, increasing the consequences of overharvest if stocks are at low abundance due to en route mortality.

The decision to change allocations between mixed- and single-stock fisheries will ultimately need to incorporate a broad range of socio-economic factors. For example, the landed value per weight terminal catches will be lower than marine caught fish because salmon expend large portions of their energy reserves while migrating [@Taylor2009]. Perhaps more importantly, increasing single-stock harvest will result in changes in access among user groups. Ideally a full management strategy evaluation could be used to specify conservation and socio-economic objectives of all stakeholders, then quantify trade-offs prior to changes in allocation [@Punt2016]. Nevertheless, these simulations demonstrate that intermediate strategies that incorporate both mixed- and single-stock fisheries may improve conservation performance while minimizing reductions in catch.
